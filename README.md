# Fluent Flashcards

This website employs Google Vision API to extract text, in various languages, from uploaded images. Using Google's Translate API and Cohere's AI API, Flash Flashcards translates the text and generates personalized flashcards for language learning of all levels. The interactive interface includes functionalities such as capturing and saving photos, facilitating the acquisition of vocabulary and language skills.

Simply snap a photo of your homework and Cohere AI will pick out key words to learn, and we'll parse it into useable flashcards -- with multiple choice questions to boot!
